    "* **Improved engagement and delight**\n",
    "    * Long-term or short term optimization.  YouTube doesn’t optimize for short-term view length, as this might encourage pushy or flashy tactics that wouldn’t genuinely delight users. Instead, the service aims to encourage long-term use, because advertising views is the ROI that these systems serve at YouTube"

Apparently, marketing reports indicate that Mac users, who spend more on their computers, are also likely to pay up to 30% more for their hotel rooms. That fact isn’t surprising, as Macs have long been associated with a somewhat richer demographic than PCs have been. But the use of that information is somewhat novel. It is also controversial: In The Wall Street Journal article’s comments section, readers posted hundreds of comments. Some vowed never to use Orbitz again; others weren’t concerned by the practice.\"\n",
