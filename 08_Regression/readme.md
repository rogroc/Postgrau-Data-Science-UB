# Regression

*Regression analysis* can help to understand the data behavior, to predict data values (continuous or discrete), and to find important predictors (sparse models).

In this notebook we present four different regression models: Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Polynomial regression and Logistic regression. 
We evaluate the analysis results qualitatively by means of Seaborn visualization tools and quantitatively by means Scikit-learn, which provides validation measures, as well as other toolboxes.

We use different real data sets:
* Longley dataset of US macroeconomic data
* Prediction of the Price of a New Housing Data Market
* Sea Ice Extent and Climate Change
* Diabetes Scikit-learn dataset
* Advertising dataset
* Winning or Losing Football Team
