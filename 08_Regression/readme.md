# Regression

*Regression analysis* can help to understand data behavior, to predict data values (continuous or discrete), and to find important predictors.

In this notebook we present four different regression models: Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Polynomial regression and Logistic regression. 
We evaluate the results qualitatively by means of Seaborn visualization tools and quantitatively by means of Scikit-learn, as well as other toolboxes.

We use different real data sets:
* Longley dataset of US macroeconomic data
* Prediction of the Price of a New Housing Data Market
* Sea Ice Extent and Climate Change
* Diabetes Scikit-learn dataset
* Advertising dataset
* The Big Mart Sales dataset

*Contents of the notebook*:
